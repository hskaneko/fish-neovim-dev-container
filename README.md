# fish-neovim-dev-container

## WIP (Work In Progress)

This repository is currently a work in progress. I'm building these containers as personalized coding environments that suit my preferences for using fish shell and neovim. More details and updates will be shared as I refine them. This project is primarily for my own use, with configurations and choice of tools reflecting my personal preferences.

### Overview

This repository houses my custom coding environment containers, tailored around `fish` and `neovim`. It's an experiment to create setups that integrate the tools and workflows I find efficient for my development tasks.

### Current Features

- Basic `fish` shell setup optimized for personal use.
- `neovim` with a set of plugins and configurations I prefer.

### Available Containers

As of now, this repository includes configurations for creating three types of containers:

- `base`: A container that is not dependent on any specific programming language. Suitable for general-purpose development or as a foundation for other containers.
- `typescript`: A container designed for TypeScript development.
- `rust`: A container designed for Rust development.
